# Difference b/w Let & Var ?
In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way of declaring variables and that was using the var keyword. A variable declared with var is defined throughout the program. One of the issues with using the var keyword was redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block. 

With the introduction of ES6 in 2015 two more keywords, let and const came into the picture. var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped. Variable declared by let cannot be redeclared and must be declared before use whereas variables declared with var keyword are hoisted.

## Difference between Primitive & Non-Primitive Datatyes ?

The difference between [primitive and non primitive](https://datatrained.com/post/difference-between-primitive-and-non-primitive/) data types is that nonprimitives can store multiple values within one object, while primitives only store single values. For example, a nonprimitive such as an array can contain several integers (like 10, 50 and 25), whereas a primitive like int can only store one integer at one time (such as 10).
